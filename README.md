# WeatherPy
## Overview
This analysis was conducted using Python, pandas, OpenWeatherMap API data, and Google Maps API data. In our analysis we created a database of cities based on randomly generated latitudes and longitudes based off of general lat/long guidelines for livable areas. We generated the nearby cities data using citipy module. Once the cities list was generated we pulled weather data from OpenWeatherMap API and pulled out the relevant data and combined it in a DataFrame. From there we refined out list of cities based on preferred temperature for vacation requiring input from user. We generated a map of hotels nearby each city that met the preferred temperature requirements using Google Maps API (gmaps). From here we determined a few cities to use within our preferred cities database to develop a vacation itinerary pulling out the latitudes and longitudes for these cities which we used to create a direction map using gmaps. Finally, we create a map using gmaps that showed our vacation itinerary cities and their weather details so we could plan ahead.
